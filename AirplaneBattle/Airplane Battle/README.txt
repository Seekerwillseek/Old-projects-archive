This Project Folder contains all the elements used in the game.

The "main.c" file is the source code of the game.

The "main.exe" is the precompiled executable of the code and the game itself.

The "res" folder contains all the sprites used in this game and the game uses
this folder to render the sprites during the execution.

The "compile.bat" is a Windows Batch File to compile the program.
Note : you will need to downlaod the mingw version of raylib (64 bit) from https://github.com/raysan5/raylib/releases/download/4.0.0/raylib_installer_v4.0.mingw.exe 
	and install on your machine , the batch file assumes you have installed the program on default location ( you can change this in the file tho )

Note : raylib uses OPENGL to render graphics , the program is simple so it will work on OPENGL version 1.x or 2.x perfectly , still it may cause some
	error (it will not render anything most probably) if there is something wrong with OPENGL , It's not going to happen but still.

Program is made to be submitted as a Micro-Project in CGR 3rd Sem by
